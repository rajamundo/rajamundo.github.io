My name is Amaraj Judge && I'm here to entertain. Or at least to try. Hopefully. Maybe. Quite Possibly. Just guess we'll have to see.

## What Are My Goals
* Make others happy and feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside
* Let people like they fit in, __Remember Kids__ its (it's? I never know) cool to be a nerd
* Show minorities that we have a voice and its getting louder
* Make people laugh (not your typical "lol" but your "LAWL", I want all the "LAWLS")
* Avoid doing real work
* Grow a beard, we all have dreams, let me have mine

## How Do I Plan On Doing This
* Slam Poems
* Raps
* Videos
* Tickling
* Blogs
* Praying to the old norse gods
* Smiling till it hurts

## Why Do I Think I Can Do This
* I don't but enough people haven't told me to quit yet so I am going to keep trying

## How Can You Be More Like Me
* Always wear more floral
* Seriously, no one has enough Hawaiian shirts and I can't let society go down this godforsaken path
